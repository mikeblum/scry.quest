| 1       | This is the lowest a score can normally go. If an effect reduces a score to 0, that effect explains what happens. |
| 2–9     | This represents a weak capability.                                                                    |
| 10–11   | This represents the human average.                                                                    |
| 12–19   | This represents a strong capability.                                                                  |
| 20      | This is the highest an adventurer’s score can go unless a feature says otherwise.                     |
| 21–29   | This represents an extraordinary capability.                                                          |
| 30      | This is the highest a score can go.                                                                   |

## Ability Modifiers

Each ability has a modifier that you apply whenever you make a D20 Test with that ability (explained in “D20 Tests”). An ability modifier is derived from its score, as shown in the Ability Modifiers table.
