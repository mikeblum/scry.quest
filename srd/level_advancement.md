# Level Advancement

While going on adventures, your character gains experience, represented by Experience Points (XP). A character who reaches a specified Experience Point total advances in capability. This advancement is called gaining a level.

The Character Advancement table lists the XP you need to advance to a level and the Proficiency Bonus for a character of that level. When your XP total equals or exceeds a number in the Experience Points column, you reach the corresponding level.

## Gaining a Level

When you gain a level, follow these steps:

**1: Choose a Class.** Most characters advance in the same class. However, you might decide to gain a level in another class using the rules in the “Multiclassing” section.
**2: Adjust Hit Points and Hit Point Dice.** Each time you gain a level, you gain an additional Hit Die. Roll that die, add your Constitution modifier to the roll, and add the total (minimum of 1) to your Hit Point maximum. Instead of rolling, you can use the fixed value shown in the Fixed Hit Points by Class table.

## Fixed Hit Points by Class

| Class                     | Hit Points per Level |
| :------------------------ | :------------------- |
| Barbarian                 | 7 + Con. modifier    |
| Fighter, Paladin, or Ranger | 6 + Con. modifier    |
| Bard, Cleric, Druid, Monk, Rogue, or Warlock | 5 + Con. modifier    |
| Sorcerer or Wizard        | 4 + Con. modifier    |

**3: Record New Class Features.** Look at your class features table in “Classes,” and note the features you gain at your new level in that class. Make any choices offered by a new feature.
**4: Adjust Proficiency Bonus.** A character’s Proficiency Bonus increases at certain levels, as shown in the Character Advancement table and your class features table in “Classes.” When your Proficiency Bonus increases, increase all the numbers on your character sheet that include your Proficiency Bonus.
**5: Adjust Ability Modifiers.** If you choose a feat that increases one or more of your ability scores, your ability modifier also changes if the new score is an even number. When that happens, adjust all the numbers on your character sheet that use that ability modifier. When your Constitution modifier increases by 1, your Hit Point maximum increases by 1 for each level you have attained. For example, if a character reaches level 8 and increases their Constitution score from 17 to 18, the Constitution modifier increases to +4. The character’s Hit Point maximum then increases by 8, in addition to the Hit Points gained for reaching level 8.
