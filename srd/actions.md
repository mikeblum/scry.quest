# Actions

When you do something other than moving or communicating, you typically take an action. The Action table lists the game’s main actions, which are defined in more detail in “Rules Glossary.”

## Actions

| Action      | Summary                                                                                                               |
| :---------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Attack      | Attack with a weapon or an Unarmed Strike.                                                                            |
| Dash        | For the rest of the turn, give yourself extra movement equal to your Speed.                                           |
| Disengage   | Your movement doesn’t provoke Opportunity Attacks for the rest of the turn.                                           |
| Dodge       | Until the start of your next turn, attack rolls against you have Disadvantage, and you make Dexterity saving throws with Advantage. You lose this benefit if you have the Incapacitated condition or if your Speed is 0. |
| Help        | Help another creature’s ability check or attack roll, or administer first aid.                                          |
| Hide        | Make a Dexterity (Stealth) check.                                                                                     |
| Influence   | Make a Charisma (Deception, Intimidation, Performance, or Persuasion) or Wisdom (Animal Handling) check to alter a creature’s attitude. |
| Magic       | Cast a spell, use a magic item, or use a magical feature.                                                             |
| Ready       | Prepare to take an action in response to a trigger you define.                                                        |
| Search      | Make a Wisdom (Insight, Medicine, Perception, or Survival) check.                                                     |
| Study       | Make an Intelligence (Arcana, History, Investigation, Nature, or Religion) check.                                     |
| Utilize     | Use a nonmagical object.                                                                                              |

Player characters and monsters can also do things not covered by these actions. Many class features and other abilities provide additional action options, and you can improvise other actions. When you describe an action not detailed elsewhere in the rules, the Game Master tells you whether that action is possible and what kind of D20 Test you need to make, if any.

## One Thing at a Time

The game uses actions to govern how much you can do at one time. You can take only one action at a time. This principle is most important in combat, as explained in “Combat” later in “Playing the Game.”

Actions can come up in other situations, too: in a social interaction, you can try to Influence a creature or use the Search action to read the creature’s body language, but you can’t do both at the same time. And when you’re exploring a dungeon, you can’t simultaneously use the Search action to look for traps and use the Help action to aid another character who’s trying to open a stuck door (with the Utilize action).
