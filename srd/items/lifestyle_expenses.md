# Lifestyle Expenses

Lifestyle expenses summarize the cost of living in a fantasy world. They cover lodging, food, equipment maintenance, and other necessities.

At the start of each week or month (GM’s choice), choose a lifestyle below—Wretched, Squalid, Poor, Modest, Comfortable, Wealthy, or Aristocratic—and pay the price to sustain that lifestyle.

Lifestyles have no inherent consequences, but the GM might take them into account when determining risks or how others perceive your character.

## Wretched (Free)

You survive via chance and charity. You’re often exposed to natural dangers as a result of sleeping outside.

## Squalid (1 SP per Day)

You spend the bare minimum for your necessities. You might be exposed to unhealthy conditions and opportunistic criminals.

## Poor (2 SP per Day)

You spend frugally for your necessities.

## Modest (1 GP per Day)

You support yourself at an average level.

## Comfortable (2 GP per Day)

You spend modestly for your necessities and enjoy a few luxuries.

## Wealthy (4 GP per Day)

You’re accustomed to the finer things in life and might have servants.

## Aristocratic (10 GP per Day)

You pay for the best and might have a staff that supports your lifestyle. Others notice your wealth and might encourage you to share it, either legally or otherwise.

## Food, Drink, and Lodging

The Food, Drink, and Lodging table gives prices for food and a single night’s lodging. Prices for daily lodging and meals are included in your lifestyle’s expenses.
