On a failed save, the target has the Restrained condition until the spell ends. On a successful save, the vines shrivel away, and the spell ends. While Restrained, the target takes 1d6 Piercing damage at the start of each of its turns. The target or a creature within reach of it can take an action to make a Strength (Athletics) check against your spell save DC. On a success, the spell ends.",
