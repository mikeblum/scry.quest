  "description": "Thin and wispy flames wreathe your body for the duration, shedding bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. You can end the spell early as an action. The flames provide you with a warm shield or a chill shield, as you choose. The warm shield grants you resistance to Cold damage, and the chill shield grants you resistance to Fire damage. In addition, whenever a creature within 5 feet of you hits you with a melee attack, the shield erupts in flame. The attacker takes 2d8 Fire damage from a warm shield, or 2d8 Cold damage from a chill shield."
