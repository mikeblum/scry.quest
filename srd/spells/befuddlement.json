  "description": "You blast the mind of a creature that you can see within range. The target makes an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 10d12 Psychic damage and canâ€™t cast spells or take the Magic action. At the end of every 30 days, the target repeats the save, ending the effect on a success. The effect can also be ended by the Greater Restoration, Heal, or Wish spell. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage only."
