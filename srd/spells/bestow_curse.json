Until the curse ends, the target suffers one of the following effects of your choice:\n\n*   Choose one ability. The target has Disadvantage on ability checks and saving throws made with that ability.\n*   The target has Disadvantage on attack rolls against you.\n*   In combat, the target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw at the start of each of its turns or be forced to take the Dodge action on that turn.\n*   If you deal damage to the target with an attack roll or a spell, the target takes an extra 1d8 Necrotic damage.",

If you use a level 5+ spell slot, the spell doesn’t require Concentration, and the duration becomes 8 hours (level 5–6 slot) or 24 hours (level 7–8 slot). If you use a level 9 spell slot, the spell lasts until dispelled."
