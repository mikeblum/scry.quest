  "description": "This spell allows you to find the shortest, most direct physical route to a specific fixed location that you are familiar with on the same plane of existence. If you name a destination on another plane of existence, a portal to that plane opens instead. For the duration, as long as you are on the same plane of existence as the destination, you know how far it is and in what direction it lies."
