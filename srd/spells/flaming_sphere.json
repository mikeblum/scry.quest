  "description": "A 5-foot-diameter sphere of fire appears in an unoccupied space of your choice within range and lasts for the duration. Any creature that ends its turn within 5 feet of the sphere must make a Dexterity saving throw. The creature takes 2d6 Fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. As a Bonus Action, you can move the sphere up to 30 feet. If you ram the sphere into a creature, that creature must make the saving throw against the sphereâ€™s damage, and the sphere stops moving this turn."
