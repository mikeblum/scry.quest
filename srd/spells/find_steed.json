  "description": "You summon a spirit that assumes the form of an unusually intelligent, strong, and loyal steed, creating a long-lasting bond with it. Appearing in an unoccupied space within range, the steed takes on a form you choose: a warhorse, a pony, a camel, an elk, or a mastiff. The steed has the statistics of the chosen form, though it is a Celestial, Fey, or Fiend (your choice) instead of its normal type. Your steed serves you as a mount, both in combat and out, and you have an instinctive bond with it that allows you to fight as a seamless unit."
