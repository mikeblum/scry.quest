  "description": "You conjure a mass of thick, sticky webbing at a point of your choice within range. The webs fill a 20-foot cube for the duration. The webs are Difficult Terrain and lightly obscure their area. If the webs arenâ€™t anchored between two solid masses (such as walls or trees) or layered across a floor, wall, or ceiling, the conjured web collapses on itself, and the spell ends at the start of your next turn. Webs layered over a flat surface have a depth of 5 feet. Each creature that starts its turn in the webs or that enters them during its turn must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is Restrained as long as it remains in the webs or until it breaks free. The webs are flammable. Any 5-foot cube of webs exposed to fire burns away in 1 round, dealing 2d4 Fire damage to any creature that starts its turn in the fire."
