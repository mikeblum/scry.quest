  "description": "An invisible cube-shaped prison appears in a space you choose within range. The prison can be a cage or a solid box, as you choose. A creature inside the prison can’t leave by nonmagical means. Spells and other magical effects can’t extend through the walls. The prison can be dispelled only by a Dispel Magic spell cast at 9th level."
