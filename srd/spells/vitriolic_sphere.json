  "description": "You point at a location within range, and a glowing 1-foot-diameter ball of acid streaks there and explodes in a 20-foot-radius sphere. Each creature in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 10d4 acid damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one. At the end of the next turn, each creature that failed the save takes 5d4 acid damage."
