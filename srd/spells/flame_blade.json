  "description": "You evoke a fiery blade in your free hand. The blade is similar in size and shape to a scimitar, and lasts for the duration. If you let go of the blade, it disappears, but you can evoke the blade again as a Bonus Action. You can use your action to make a melee spell attack with the fiery blade. On a hit, the target takes 3d6 Fire damage. The blade sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet."
