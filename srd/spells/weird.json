  "description": "You draw on the deepest fears of a group of creatures, creating illusory manifestations in a 30-foot-radius Sphere centered on a point within range. Each creature in the Sphere must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 4d10 Psychic damage and has the Frightened condition for the duration. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage only and isnâ€™t Frightened. At the end of each of its turns, a Frightened creature can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success."
