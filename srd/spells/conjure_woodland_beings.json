Whenever the Emanation enters the space of a creature you can see and whenever a creature you can see enters the Emanation or ends its turn there, you can force that creature to make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 5d8 Force damage on a successful one. A creature makes this save only once per turn. In addition, you can take the Disengage action as a Bonus Action for the spellâ€™s duration.",
