  "description": "You ward a creature within range. Until the spell ends, any creature who targets the warded creature with an attack roll or a damaging spell must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or either choose a new target or lose the attack or spell. This spell doesnâ€™t protect the warded creature from areas of effect. The spell ends if the warded creature makes an attack roll, casts a spell, or deals damage."
