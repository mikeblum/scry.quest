  "description": "You conjure a phantom watchdog in an unoccupied space that you can see within range, where it remains for the duration until you dismiss it as an action or until you move more than 100 feet away from it. The hound is invisible to all creatures except you and can’t be harmed. When a Small or larger creature comes within 30 feet of it without first speaking the password that you specify when you cast this spell, the hound starts barking loudly. The hound sees invisible creatures and can see into the Ethereal Plane. It has darkvision out to 30 feet and can hear as well as a human. As a Magic action, you can command the hound to make a bite attack against a creature within 5 feet of it. The hound’s attack bonus is equal to your spellcasting ability modifier + your proficiency bonus. On a hit, the target takes 4d8 Piercing damage."
