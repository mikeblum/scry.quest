# Ability Checks

An ability check represents a creature using talent and training to try to overcome a challenge, such as forcing open a stuck door, picking a lock, entertaining a crowd, or deciphering a cipher. The GM and the rules often call for an ability check when a creature attempts something other than an attack that has a chance of meaningful failure. When the outcome is uncertain and narratively interesting, the dice determine the result.

## Ability Modifier

An ability check is named for the ability modifier it uses: a Strength check, an Intelligence check, and so on. Different ability checks are called for in different situations, depending on which ability is most relevant. See the Ability Check Examples table for examples of each check’s use.

## Ability Check Examples

| Ability      | Make a Check To …                     |
| :----------- | :------------------------------------ |
| Strength     | Lift, push, pull, or break something  |
| Dexterity    | Move nimbly, quickly, or quietly      |
| Constitution | Push your body beyond normal limits   |
| Intelligence | Reason or remember                    |
| Wisdom       | Notice things in the environment or in creatures’ behavior |
| Charisma     | Influence, entertain, or deceive      |

## Proficiency Bonus

Add your Proficiency Bonus to an ability check when the GM determines that a skill or tool proficiency is relevant to the check and you have that proficiency. For example, if a rule refers to a Strength (Acrobatics or Athletics) check, you can add your Proficiency Bonus to the check if you have proficiency in the Acrobatics or Athletics skill. See “Proficiency” later in “Playing the Game” for more information about skill and tool proficiencies.

## Difficulty Class

The Difficulty Class of an ability check represents the task’s difficulty. The more difficult the task, the higher its DC. The rules provide DCs for certain checks, but the GM ultimately sets them. The Typical Difficulty Classes table presents a range of possible DCs for ability checks.

## Typical Difficulty Classes

| Task Difficulty     | DC | Task Difficulty   | DC |
| :------------------ | :-- | :---------------- | :-- |
| Very easy           | 5  | Very hard         | 25 |
| Easy                | 10 | Nearly impossible | 30 |
| Medium              | 15 |                   |    |
| Hard                | 20 |                   |    |
