# Travel

During an adventure, the characters might travel long distances on trips that could take hours or days. The GM can summarize this travel without calculating exact distances or travel times, or the GM might have you use the travel pace rules below.

If you need to know how fast you can move when every second matters, see the movement rules in “Combat” later in “Playing the Game.”

## Travel Pace

While traveling outside combat, a group can move at a Fast, Normal, or Slow pace, as shown on the Travel Pace table. The table states how far the party can move in a period of time; if riding horses or other mounts, the group can move twice that distance for 1 hour, after which the mounts need a Short or Long Rest before they can move at that increased pace again (see “Equipment” for a selection of mounts for sale). “Gameplay Toolbox” has rules that affect which pace you can choose in certain types of terrain.

## Travel Pace

| Pace    | Distance Traveled Per … |
| :------ | :---------------------- |
|         | Minute    | Hour     | Day      |
| Fast    | 400 feet  | 4 miles  | 30 miles |
| Normal  | 300 feet  | 3 miles  | 24 miles |
| Slow    | 200 feet  | 2 miles  | 18 miles |

Each travel pace has a game effect, as defined below.

**Fast.** Traveling at a Fast pace imposes Disadvantage on a traveler’s Wisdom (Perception or Survival) and Dexterity (Stealth) checks.
**Normal.** Traveling at a Normal pace imposes Disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks.
**Slow.** Traveling at a Slow pace grants Advantage on Wisdom (Perception or Survival) checks.

## Vehicles

Travelers in wagons, carriages, or other land vehicles choose a pace as normal. Characters in a waterborne vessel are limited to the speed of the vessel, and they don’t choose a travel pace. Depending on the vessel and the size of the crew, ships might be able to travel for up to 24 hours per day. “Equipment” includes vehicles for sale.
