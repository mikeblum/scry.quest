# Underwater Combat

A fight underwater follows these rules.

## Impeded Weapons

When making a melee attack roll with a weapon underwater, a creature that lacks a Swim Speed has Disadvantage on the attack roll unless the weapon deals Piercing damage.

A ranged attack roll with a weapon underwater automatically misses a target beyond the weapon’s normal range, and the attack roll has Disadvantage against a target within normal range.

## Fire Resistance

Anything underwater has Resistance to Fire damage (explained in “Damage and Healing”).
